## Setup

You must have [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) installed.


You must use the version or ruby specified in the `.rvmrc` file. If you have [rvm](https://rvm.io/) already installed, you can simply run

```bash
source ./.rvmrc
```

Then, you must install the dependencies:

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

## Runing the spec

You can then run the specs using the following command:

```bash
source ./.rvmrc
```
